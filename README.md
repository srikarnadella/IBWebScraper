# Investment Banking Web Scraper

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script tailored for investment bankers to automate the retrieval of financial data from public companies, conduct Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, and generate comprehensive Excel reports. The current version focuses on publicly traded companies with data accessible via Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.

## Features
- **Financial Data Scraping**: Automatically fetches financial statements including income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement from Yahoo Finance.
- **DCF Calculation**: Estimates future cash flows, applies discount rates, and calculates the present value to determine intrinsic company value.
- **Excel Report Generation**: Creates detailed Excel reports with formatted sheets containing financial data, DCF valuation, charts, and summary metrics.

## Usage
1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Install necessary Python packages:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   
2. **Running the Script**:
   - Execute the script with a company ticker symbol:
     ```
     python financialDataScraper.py AAPL
     ```
   - Replace `AAPL` with the ticker symbol of any publicly traded company.

3. **Output**:
   - The script generates an Excel file named `{ticker}_financial_data.xlsx` containing multiple sheets:
     - **Financial Data**: Detailed financial statements and charts.
     - **Balance Sheet**: Comprehensive balance sheet data.
     - **Cash Flow**: Detailed cash flow statement data.
     - **DCF Calculation**: Summary of DCF valuation.
     - **Summary**: Key metrics including the calculated DCF value with conditional formatting.

## Next Version: Adapting for Private/Smaller Companies
The next version of this project aims to enhance its capabilities to gather and analyze financial data from private or smaller companies. This adaptation is crucial because private companies often lack publicly available financial information, making traditional data sources like Yahoo Finance inadequate.

### Challenges and Solutions:
- **Data Sources**: Implementing web scraping techniques to extract financial data from private company websites and databases.
- **Data Cleaning and Parsing**: Developing robust methods to clean and parse diverse data formats, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
- **Enhanced DCF Modeling**: Adapting DCF models to accommodate unique aspects of private company valuations, such as different growth trajectories and risk profiles.

## About Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Models
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis is a fundamental valuation method used in finance to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. DCF models are widely employed in investment banking, equity research, and corporate finance for company valuations, project evaluations, and investment decisions.

### Key Components of DCF Models:
1. **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: Represents the cash generated by the company after accounting for capital expenditures necessary to maintain or expand its asset base.

2. **Discount Rate**: Also known as the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), it reflects the rate of return required by investors to compensate for the risk of investing in the company.

3. **Terminal Value**: Represents the value of all future cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period. Terminal value can be estimated using methods such as the perpetuity growth model or exit multiple methods.

4. **Present Value**: Calculating the present value of all projected future cash flows and terminal value provides an estimate of the intrinsic value of the company or investment.

### Advantages of DCF Models:
- **Intrinsic Valuation**: DCF focuses on the fundamental value of a company based on its expected cash flows, rather than market sentiment.
- **Flexibility**: Can be adapted to various industries and business models, allowing for customized analysis and comparison.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Enables sensitivity testing to assess how changes in key assumptions impact valuation outputs, providing insights into risk factors and uncertainties.

### Limitations of DCF Models:
- **Assumption Sensitivity**: DCF models are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding future cash flows, growth rates, and discount rates. Small changes in assumptions can lead to significant variations in valuation outcomes.
- **Forecast Accuracy**: Relies on accurate financial projections and market assumptions which can be challenging, especially for long-term forecasts in uncertain economic conditions.
- **Subjectivity**: Requires judgment in selecting appropriate discount rates and growth assumptions, introducing potential biases and variability in valuation results among analysts.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a foundational tool for investment bankers and finance professionals interested in automating financial data retrieval and conducting rigorous DCF valuations for publicly traded companies. Future versions will expand its capabilities to address the unique challenges of valuing private and smaller companies, enhancing its utility across broader segments of the financial industry.
